## Hello! 👋

I'm Leila, a self-taught **Junior Fullstack Web Developer**! Computers are one of my biggest interests. I started learning programming when I was 11!

I'm also an artist, and I love working on colorful projects in which creativity and code meet.

I'm a part-time student looking for a job!

## What I'm Currently Doing

I'm cleaning up some personal projects to finally upload them on Github.

I'm writing some Wordpress themes.

## My pros

**I focus on learning solid foundations.** The web is based on HTTP requests. Most programs write to stdout. Bubble sort always works in the same way. When I know the basics of something, then I can spin it around and break it apart more effectively.

**I'm aware of the fact that I still have much to learn.** With every new project I start I try to learn something new. Dealing with errors is part of the process. Fail faster to learn quicker.

**I choose the right tools for the job.** If the project I'm working on is simple and doesn't have any specific requirements, then I'm going to work with the simplest possible stack. Simple projects should be built in a simple way.

**I'm a Linux user.** I have been using Linux as the only operating system on my personal computer for almost ten years now. I cannot work without having a TTY interface nearby.

**I'm an "old school", no bells-and-whistles kinda developer.** Give me a text editor and I will be able to program anything. I have a hard time using modern applications like Figma.

**I do not use AI tools.** I am not interested in working on projects involving the use of AI either. I believe that technology should strive to be sustainable and ethical. Instead of using AI assistants, I focus on learning skills that I will be able to use in any scenario.

## My cons

**I still have to learn at least one modern web framework.** I'm learning React, but it's hard to find a use case for it in my projects when simpler tools do the job.

**I do not think Leetcode is useful.** I would rather learn how to solve real-world problems.

**I still haven't done any CI/CD.** But I did start to write automatic tests. (Should be a good start I think)

**I do not know how to deal with complex security issues.** I sanitize user input and I choose strong passwords, but I'm not learning how to become a security professional. I'll have to leave that to someone else.

**...I still never accidentally wiped a production database?** Some say it's a "rite of passage", and that basically every backend developer has done so at some point. But I still didn't. That means I'm coming for YOUR database 🙃️
